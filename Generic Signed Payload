## Abstract

The payload concept offers a very flexible way to combine and encapsulate information in the IOTA protocol. This document proposes a basic singed payload type that allows the addition of arbitrary signed data.

## Motivation

To support low-cost applications we need to create a selective permanode inx plug-in, and to make it reliable we need a standard method for identifying fake blocks.

This TIP is intended to define a block payload format that can be recognized as true or false by a standard method.


## Specification

Detailed design

Serialized Layout

The following table describes the serialization of Data field of a _Singed Tagged Data Payload_ following the notation from [TIP-21](../TIP-0021/tip-0021.md):

| Name         | Type              | Description                                                                               |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Payload Type | uint32            | Set to *value 6* to denote an _Signed Data Payload_.                                      |
| Tag          | (uint8)ByteArray  | The tag of the data. A leading uint8 denotes its length.                                  |
| Public key   | ByteArray[32]     | The public key of the Ed25519 keypair which is used to verify the correspondig signature. |
| Singature    | ByteArray[64]     | Ed25519 signature signing the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the Data                                |
| Data         | (uint32)ByteArray | Binary data. A leading uint32 denotes its length.                                         |

It is important to note that `Tag`, `Public key` and `Signature` are not considered by the protocol, they just serves as a marker for second layer applications.

## Syntactic Validation

- `length(Tag)` must not be larger than [`Max Tag Length`](../TIP-0022/tip-0022.md).
- Given the type and length information, the _Singed Tagged Data Payload_ must consume the entire byte array of the `Payload` field of the encapsulating object.


## Rationale
This is a very simple soltution to allow to build selective permanodes and basic application that share data over the tangle with enough reliability.

## Backwards Compatibility
Not relevant

## Test Cases
The test case is the implementation of the INX Selective Permanode
