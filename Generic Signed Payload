## Abstract
Many applications that generate and publish data can benefit from the IOTA network as a transport layer. The STREAM protocol/library is designed to fulfill this purpose, ensuring that the sender is identified and thus that messages containing false data cannot be created.
However, for many low-cost applications STREAM can be too expensive and complex while writing data into the generic payload of a Tange Message (TIP-6) is very simple.

In addition the pruning of the tangle performed by the nodes make the message reception unreliable.

The solution is to create a simple INX plug-in for the node that can filter messages received by the node based on their tag and store them in a local database and then provide them to the user on demand. 

Obviously, the user will have to worry about deleting superfluous messages from this database and providing the node with sufficient storage space. 
To confirm that the messages that are stored are correct and real, the node also calculates and stores a Proof of Inclusion for each message.

This approach can also be used for other purposes, however, it is subject to a simple attack: the tag, the only element that can be used to distinguish messages without getting into the paylod, can be arbirally compiled, so a malicious publisher can create fake messages that the receiver cannot recognize.


## Motivation

To support low-cost applications we need to create a selective permanode inx plug-in, and to make it reliable we need a standard method for identifying fake messages.

This TIP is intended to define a message format that can be recognized as true or false by a standard method.


## Specification

Detailed design

The following describes the standard method for creating a generic message containing data whose validity can be verified by the receiver.

The structure of the message is described here: https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/main/tips/TIP-0006/tip-0006.md#indexation-payload

The date field must contain:
- Public key
- Signature field of the following data field
- Data field (type: ByteArray)


## Rationale
This is a very simple soltution to allow to build selective permanodes and basic application that share data over the tangle with enough reliability.

## Backwards Compatibility
Not relevant

## Test Cases
The test case is the implementation of the INX Selective Permanode
