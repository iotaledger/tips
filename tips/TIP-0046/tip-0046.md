# Summary

The Tangle is the graph data structure behind IOTA. For the Stardust upgrade an additional abstraction layer on top of
legacy IOTA version transactions was introduced where the vertices are generalized _blocks_, which then contain the
transactions or other structures that are processed by the IOTA protocol. Just as before, each block directly approves
other blocks, which are known as _parents_. The new block structure matches the requirements introduced by the IOTA 2.0
version of the protocol. A new type of block is introduced, the _Validation Block_. It is a special type of block that
is used by validators. Validation Blocks have additional functionality and different fields and validation rules. To
better distinguish the _Validation Block_ from the previously introduced _Block_, the latter is renamed to _Basic
Block_. A _Basic Block_ can contain different types of payloads which are processed by all nodes as part of the IOTA
protocol. Some payloads may have other nested payloads embedded inside. Hence, parsing is done layer by layer.

# Motivation

To better understand this layered design, consider the Internet Protocol (IP), for example: There is an Ethernet frame
that contains an IP payload. This in turn contains a TCP packet that encapsulates an HTTP payload. Each layer has a
certain responsibility and once this responsibility is completed, we move on to the next layer.

The same is true with how blocks are parsed. The outer layer of the block enables the mapping of the block to a vertex
in the Tangle and allows us to perform some basic validation. The next layer may be a transaction that mutates the
ledger state, and one layer further may provide some extra functionality on the transactions to be used by applications.

By making it possible to add and exchange payloads, an architecture is being created that can easily be extended to
accommodate future needs.

# Building Blocks

This section describes common building blocks used across multiple block types.

## Data Types & Subschema Notation

Data types and subschemas used throughout this TIP are defined in [TIP-21](../TIP-0021/tip-0021.md).

## BLAKE2b Hash Function

This TIP uses the [BLAKE2b-256](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7693) hash function.

## Work Score

The Work Score expresses the cost of an object in terms of computational requirements for a node to process it. It
differs from the storage deposit in that it only accounts for one-off costs that the processing of a block and its
payload incur, while the storage deposit accounts for recurring costs like data storage or holding block issuer keys in
memory. The work score attempts to encapsulate all processing steps carried out on this object throughout its life in
the node. The calculation of the work score is done with the use of the _Work Score Parameters_ protocol parameters. The
work score is expressed as a `uint32` and all operations used in its calculation are integer arithmetic.

## Time

Protocol time is divided into slots and epochs. And epoch consists of <code>2<sup>Slots Per Epoch Exponent</sup></code>
slots and each slot is `Slot Duration In Seconds` seconds in length.

### Slot Index

Each slot has a corresponding slot index, which is a `uint32`. To calculate the slot index of a timestamp, the protocol
parameters `Genesis Slot`, `Genesis Unix Timestamp` and `Slot Duration In Seconds` are used. The slot index of a Unix
timestamp `Unix Timestamp` (in seconds) is calculated as follows:

- Compute `Elapsed Time` as `Unix Timestamp - Genesis Unix Timestamp`.
- If `Elapsed Time < 0`, the slot index is `Genesis Slot`.
- Otherwise the slot index is `Genesis Slot + Elapsed Time/Slot Duration In Seconds + 1`.
  - Note: The `+ 1` is required because slots are counted starting from `1`. `0` is reserved for times before the
    genesis (if `Genesis Slot = 0`), which has to be addressable as its own slot.

### Epoch Index

Each epoch has a corresponding epoch index, which is a `uint32`. To calculate the epoch index of a slot index, that is,
the index of the epoch to which the slot belongs, the protocol parameter `Slots Per Epoch Exponent` is used. The epoch
index of a slot index `Slot Index` is `Slot Index >> Slots Per Epoch Exponent`, where `>>` is the _zero-fill
right-shift_ or _logical shift_ operation.

## Slot Commitment

A Slot Commitment contains a summary of a slot. The Slot Commitment is serialized as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Version</td>
    <td>uint8</td>
    <td>
      The version of the protocol in which this commitment was created.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Index</td>
    <td>uint32</td>
    <td>
      The slot index.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prev ID</td>
    <td>ByteArray[36]</td>
    <td>The slot identifier of the previous slot in the chain.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Roots ID</td>
    <td>ByteArray[32]</td>
    <td>The Merkle Tree Root of all commitment elements.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cumulative Weight</td>
    <td>uint64</td>
    <td>The weight of the chain of the <code>Index</code> minus <code>Maximum Committable Age</code> slots in the past. This value is required for attestations and is used by node in chain switching mechanism.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>RMC</td>
    <td>uint64</td>
    <td>This field provides the Reference Mana Cost (RMC) to be used for Mana burn calculations for blocks that included this commitment. Each new RMC value for a slot with index <code>i</code> is calculated upon commitment based on the RMC from slot <code>i - 1</code> and the total work score of blocks in slot <code>i</code>. It is convenient to store the RMC in the commitment to avoid having to recalculate it from genesis when syncing.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Slot Commitment ID

A Slot Commitment ID denotes an identifier of a slot commitment, with type `ByteArray[36]`. It is calculated with the
following steps:

- Let `Content` be the serialized slot commitment.
- Let `Content Hash` be the BLAKE2b-256 hash of `Content`.
- Let `Slot Index` be the slot index of the slot commitment.
- Let `Serialized Slot Index` be the little-endian serialized `Slot Index`.
- Let `Commitment ID` be the concatenation of `Content Hash` and `Slot Index`.

The string format of a Slot Commitment ID is the hexadecimal encoding of the Slot Commitment ID with `0x` prefix.

### Semantic Validation

- The `Index` of the commitment must be in the closed interval
  `[Block Slot - Max Committable Age, Block Slot - Min Committable Age]`, where `Block Slot` is the slot index
  corresponding to the `Issuing Time` of the block containing the commitment.

## Block Signature

The [_Ed25519 Signature_](../TIP-0038/tip-0038.md#ed25519-signature) is supported.

### Signature Creation

The _Signature_ field over the block is computed as follows:

- Let `Header Hash` be the BLAKE2b-256 hash over the serialized `Header`.
- Let `Body Hash` be the BLAKE2b-256 hash over the serialized content of the `Body` field.
- Let `Signing Input` be the concatenation of `Header Hash` and `Body Hash`.
- Let the resulting signature be the Ed25519 signature of `Signing Input`.

### Semantic Validation

In order for the signature to be valid all of the following conditions must hold:

- The `Public Key` must verify the `Signature`, according to [TIP-14](../TIP-0014/tip-0014.md).
- The `Public Key` must be included as a _Block Issuer Key_ in the Account identified by the block's `Issuer ID` field.
  This check is executed against the account state at the slot index corresponding to the slot commitment of the block.

### Work Score

Let the Work Score of a Signature be defined as follows.

- If the type is _Ed25519 Signature_ the work score is `Work Score Parameters::Signature Ed25519`.

# Block

A block consists of a header, body and a signature. The body defines the concrete flavor of a block.

The schema of a block is as follows:

<details>
  <summary>Block</summary>
  <blockquote>The block consisting of a header, body and signature.</blockquote>

## Block ID

A Block ID denotes an identifier of a block, with type `ByteArray[36]`. It is created from three separately spelled out
fields due to commitment proof requirements to keep attestation proofs lightweight. It is calculated with the following
steps:

- Let `Header Hash` be the BLAKE2b-256 hash over the serialized `Header`.
- Let `Body Hash` be the BLAKE2b-256 hash over the serialized content of the `Body` field.
- Let `Serialized Signature` be the serialized `Signature`.
- Let `ID` be the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the concatenation of `Header Hash`, `Body Hash` and `Serialized Signature`.
- Let `Slot Index` be the slot index of the `Issuing Time` of the block.
- Let `Serialized Slot Index` be the little-endian serialized `Slot Index`.
- Let `Block ID` be the concatenation of `ID` and `Serialized Slot Index`.

The string format of the Block ID is the hexadecimal encoding of the `Block ID` with a `0x` prefix.

  </tr>

### Syntactic validation

The Tangle can only contain syntactically valid blocks. Invalid blocks must be rejected by the node. A _Basic Block_ is
syntactically valid if all of the following conditions hold:

- The block adheres to its schema with the rules defined in [TIP-21](../TIP-0021/tip-0021.md).
- The total length of the serialized block must not exceed `Max Block Length`.
- It must hold true that 1 ≤ `Strong Parents Count` ≤ 8.
- It must hold true that 0 ≤ `Weak Parents Count` ≤ 8.
- It must hold true that 0 ≤ `Shallow Like Parents Count` ≤ 8.
- `Strong Parents`, `Weak Parents`, `Shallow Like Parents` must comply with the following rules:
  - must be lexically ordered.
  - must not have duplicates in each list.
- `Weak Parents` must be disjoint from the rest of the parents: No weak parent should be in either `Strong Parents` or
  `Shallow Like Parents`.
- There must be no trailing bytes after all block fields have been parsed.
- If a _Basic Block_ contains a transaction payload, the block is valid only if all of the following conditions hold:
  - The Slot Index `Block Slot` corresponding to the `Issuing Time` of a block must be greater or equal than the
    `Creation Slot` of the contained transaction.
  - If the transaction includes a `Commitment Input`, the `Slot Index` field of the commitment to which the input
    resolves must be in the closed interval `[Block Slot - Max Committable Age, Block Slot - Min Committable Age]`.

### Semantic Validation

A _Basic Block_ is semantically valid if the following condition holds:

- The `Signature` must pass semantic validation.

### Payloads

While blocks without a payload, i.e. `Payload Length` set to zero, are valid, such blocks do not contain any
information. As such, blocks usually contain a payload. The detailed specification of each payload type is out of scope
of this TIP. The following table lists all currently specified payloads that can be part of a block and links to their
specification:

| Payload Name | Type Value | TIP                               |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| No Payload   | -          | -                                 |
| Tagged Data  | 0          | [TIP-23](../TIP-0023/tip-0023.md) |
| Transaction  | 1          | [TIP-45](../TIP-0045/tip-0045.md) |

### Work Score

Let the work score of a _Basic Block_ be defined as follows.

- Let `Payload Score` be the work score of the contained `Payload` if it exists, or `0` if it does not exist.
  - If the type is _Tagged Data_ the work score is `Work Score Parameters::Data Byte * Tagged Data Size` where:
    - `Tagged Data Size` is the size of the serialized _Tagged Data_.
  - If the type is _Transaction_ the work score is defined in TIP-45.
- Return `Work Score Parameters::Block + Payload Score`.

## Validation Block

A Validation Block is a type of block used by validators to secure the network. It is recognised by the Congestion
Control of the IOTA 2.0 protocol and can be issued without burning Mana within the constraints of the allowed validator
throughput. It is allowed to reference more parent blocks than a _Basic Block_.

### Syntactic Validation

The Tangle can only contain syntactically valid blocks. Invalid blocks must be rejected by the node. A _Validation
Block_ is syntactically valid if all of the following conditions hold:

- The block adheres to its schema with the rules defined in [TIP-21](../TIP-0021/tip-0021.md).
- The total length of the serialized block must not exceed `Max Block Length`.
- It must hold true that 1 ≤ `Strong Parents Count` ≤ 50.
- It must hold true that 0 ≤ `Weak Parents Count` ≤ 50.
- It must hold true that 0 ≤ `Shallow Like Parents Count` ≤ 50.
- `Strong Parents`, `Weak Parents`, `Shallow Like Parents` must comply with the following rules:
  - must be lexically ordered.
  - must not have duplicates in each list.
- `Weak Parents` must be disjoint from the rest of the parents: No weak parent should be in either `Strong Parents` or
  `Shallow Like Parents`.
- `Highest Supported Version` must be greater or equal to `Protocol Version`.
- There must be no trailing bytes after all block fields have been parsed.

### Semantic Validation

A _Validation Block_ is semantically valid if the following condition holds:

- The `Signature` must pass semantic validation.

## Work Score

The work score of a _Validation Block_ is `0`.

# Rationale and alternatives

**Block ID & Signature**

Splitting the signing input of a Block Signature into a header and body part allows for verification of an attestation
where only the header and body hash are known. In a similar way, a Block ID can be recomputed from an attestation
without having the entire block.

**Validation Block**

The alternative could be to use a `Block` instead of `Validation Block` with some additional validation logic. However,
having a separate block body type for validator related responsibilities is much cleaner and allows for additional
changes like allowing to reference more parents, or having specific payload types or fields in the future.

**Burned Mana**

The rationale for including the `Max Burned Mana` field on the block is the following. For a given block, the account
identified by the `Issuer ID` field on the block needs to burn the amount of Mana corresponding to the RMC and the block
size. A malicious node might provide a false, lower RMC value. If the field was not present, the required Mana would be
deducted from the account's Block Issuance Credit (BIC), but the account would not allot enough Mana in the containing
transaction, since it assumed a lower RMC value. This would result in a negative BIC balance and the locking of the
account. The `Max Burned Mana` field prevents this situation by effectively stating the assumption under which the
account operates. If `Max Burned Mana` is lower than it should be, the block can simply be dropped without incurring a
cost for the issuing account. Thus, as long as `Max Burned Mana` matches the amount allotted in the contained
transaction, the transaction will never result in the locking of the account.
