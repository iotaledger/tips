# Summary

An Anchor Output represents an output in the ledger with two control levels and a permanent Anchor Address. The anchor
owns other outputs that are locked under Anchor Address. The anchor keeps track of state transitions (`State Index`
counter) and can be used to anchor layer 2 state as metadata into the UTXO ledger. The Anchor ID, the unique identifier,
is generated deterministically by the protocol and is not allowed to change in any future state transitions.

The Anchor Output can be seen as the successor to the Alias Output in [TIP-18](../TIP-0018/tip-0018.md). However the
Anchor Output is not a strict extension of the functionality of the Alias Output.

## Summary of changes compared to TIP-18

Compared to the _Alias Output_:

- Add `Mana` field to the `Anchor`.
- Remove `Foundry Counter` field. The [_Account Output_](../TIP-0042/tip-0042.md#account-output) can hold Foundries
  instead. See that TIP for _Alias Output_ migration details.
- Remove `Native Tokens` field. See [TIP-38 (Native Token Migration)](../TIP-0038/tip-0038.md#native-token-migration)
  for migration details.

# Motivation

This TIP defines an Anchor Output type for the use case of anchoring state into Layer 1. The prime example for state
anchoring are IOTA Smart Contract Chains. This TIP accommodates that use case in particular through the two levels of
control given by the _state controller_ and _governor_. A governor can control the parameters of the chain and who is
allowed to change the state, but cannot do so themselves, while a state controller is allowed to update the state.

The additional constraints are defined in [Anchor Output Design](#anchor-output) section.

## Anchor Locking & Unlocking

A transaction may consume an output that belongs to an <i>Anchor Address</i> by transitioning the anchor output with the
matching `Anchor ID`. This serves the exact same purpose as providing a signature to unlock an output locked under a
private key backed address, such as <i>Ed25519 Addresses</i>.

On protocol level, anchor unlocking is done using a new unlock type, called **Anchor Unlock**.

<details>
  <summary>Anchor Unlock</summary>
  <blockquote>Points to the unlock of a consumed Anchor Output.</blockquote>
</details>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>Name</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      <b>Type</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      <b>Description</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unlock Type</td>
    <td>uint8</td>
    <td>Set to <strong>value 3</strong> to denote an <i>Anchor Unlock</i>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Anchor Reference Unlock Index</td>
    <td>uint16</td>
    <td>Index of input and unlock corresponding to an Anchor Output.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This unlock is similar to the <i>Reference Unlock</i>. However, it is valid if and only if the input of the transaction
at index `Anchor Reference Unlock Index` is an anchor output with the same `Anchor ID` as the one derived from the
`Address` field of the to-be unlocked output.

Additionally, the <i>Anchor Unlocks</i> must also be ordered to prevent circular dependencies:

If the i-th _Unlock_ of a transaction is an _Anchor Unlock_ and has `Anchor Reference Unlock Index` set to k, it must
hold that i > k. Hence, an <i>Anchor Unlock</i> can only reference an _Unlock_ (unlocking the corresponding anchor) at a
smaller index.

For example the scenario where `Anchor A` is locked to the address of `Anchor B` while `Anchor B` is in locked to the
address of `Anchor A` introduces a circular dependency and is not well-defined. By requiring the _Unlocks_ to be ordered
as described above, a transaction consuming `Anchor A` as well as `Anchor B` can never be valid as there would always
need to be one _Anchor Unlock_ referencing a greater index.

#### Anchor Unlock Syntactic Validation

- It must hold that 0 ≤ `Anchor Reference Unlock Index` < `Max Inputs Count - 1`.

#### Anchor Unlock Semantic Validation

- The address of the unlocking condition of the input being unlocked must be an <i>Anchor Address</i>.
- The index `i` of the _Anchor Unlock_ is the index of the input in the transaction that it unlocks.
  `Anchor Reference Unlock Index` must be < `i`.
- `Anchor Reference Unlock Index` defines a previous input of the transaction and its unlock. This input must be an
  _Anchor Output_ with `Anchor ID` that refers to the _Anchor Address_ being unlocked.
- The referenced _Anchor Output_ must be unlocked.

# Anchor Output

The _Anchor Output_ is a specific implementation of a UTXO state machine. `Anchor ID`, the unique identifier of an
instance of the deployed state machine, is generated deterministically by the protocol and is not allowed to change in
any future transitions.

An _Anchor Output_ is an output with a permanent _Anchor Address_ and owns other outputs that are locked under this
_Anchor Address_.

## Additional Transaction Syntactic Validation Rules

### Output Syntactic Validation

- It must hold true that `Unlock Conditions Count = 2`.
- `Unlock Condition Type` of an <i>Unlock Condition</i> must define one of the following types:
  - <i>State Controller Address Unlock Condition</i>
  - <i>Governor Address Unlock Condition</i>
- <i>Unlock Conditions</i> must be sorted in ascending order based on their `Unlock Condition Type`.
- Syntactic validation of all present unlock conditions must pass.
- It must hold true that `0` ≤ `Features Count` ≤ `2`.
- `Feature Type` of a <i>Feature</i> in `Features` must define one of the following types:
  - <i>Sender Feature</i>
  - <i>Metadata Feature</i>
- It must hold true that `0` ≤ `Immutable Features Count` ≤ `2`.
- `Feature Type` of a <i>Feature</i> in `Immutable Features` must define on of the following types:
  - <i>Issuer Feature</i>
  - <i>Metadata Feature</i>
- <i>Features</i> must be sorted in ascending order based on their `Feature Type` both in `Features` and
  `Immutable Features` fields.
- Syntactic validation of all present features must pass.
- The length of the `State Metadata` field must not be greater than `8192`.
- `Address` of _State Controller Address Unlock Condition_ and `Address` of _Governor Address Unlock Condition_ must be
  different from the anchor address derived from `Anchor ID`.

## Additional Transaction Semantic Validation Rules

- Explicit `Anchor ID`: `Anchor ID` is taken as the value of the `Anchor ID` field in the anchor output.
- Implicit `Anchor ID`: When an anchor output is consumed as an input in a transaction and the `Anchor ID` field is
  zeroed out, take the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the `Output ID` of the input as `Anchor ID`.
- For every non-zero explicit `Anchor ID` on the output side there must be a corresponding anchor on the input side. The
  corresponding anchor has the explicit or implicit `Anchor ID` equal to that of the anchor on the output side.

### Consumed Outputs

Whenever an anchor output is consumed in a transaction, it means that the anchor is transitioned into its next state.
The **current state** is defined as the **consumed anchor output**, while the **next state** is defined as the **anchor
output with the same explicit `AnchorID` on the output side**. There are two types of transitions: `state transition`
and `governance transition`.

- State transition:
  - A state transition is identified by an incremented `State Index`.
  - The `State Index` must be incremented by 1.
  - The unlock must correspond to the `Address` of <i>State Controller Address Unlock Condition</i>.
  - State transition can only change the following fields in the next state:
    - `Amount`,
    - `Mana`,
    - `State Index`,
    - `State Metadata`,
    - `Sender Feature` in `Features`.
- Governance transition:
  - A governance transition is identified by an unchanged `State Index` in next state. If there is no anchor output on
    the output side with a corresponding explicit `Anchor ID`, the anchor is being destroyed. The next state is the
    empty state. The transaction is invalid if an Anchor Output is burned and the _Can destroy Anchor Outputs_ flag in
    the _Transaction Capabilities_ is **unset**.
  - The unlock must correspond to the `Address` of <i>Governor Address Unlock Condition</i>.
  - Governance transition must only change the following fields:
    - `Address` of <i>State Controller Address Unlock Condition</i>,
    - `Address` of <i>Governor Address Unlock Condition</i>,
    - `Metadata Feature`, `Sender Feature` in `Features`.
  - The `Metadata Feature` is optional, the governor can put additional info about the chain here, for example chain
    name, fee structure, supported VMs, list of access nodes, etc., anything that helps clients to fetch info (i.e.
    anchor balances) about the layer 2 network.
- When a consumed anchor output has <i>Features</i> defined in `Immutable Features` and a corresponding anchor output on
  the output side, `Immutable Features` is not allowed to change.

### Created Outputs

- When <i>Issuer Feature</i> is present in an output and explicit `Anchor ID` is zeroed out, an input with `Address`
  field that corresponds to `Issuer` must be unlocked in the transaction.

### Notes

- Indexers and node plugins shall map the anchor address of the output derived with `Anchor ID` to the regular
  <i>address -> output</i> mapping table, so that given an <i>Anchor Address</i>, its most recent unspent anchor output
  can be retrieved.
