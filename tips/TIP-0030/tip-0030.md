## Abstract

This TIP describes a JSON schema to store native token metadata on-chain in foundry outputs.

## Motivation

By introducing a standardized token metadata schema we aim to address the following problems:
 - Storing structured token metadata on-chain,
 - Interoperability of dApps, wallets and clients handling native tokens,
 - Creating the possibility of off-chain token verification based on social consensus.

## Specification

Native tokens are user defined tokens controlled by foundries, as described in
[TIP-18](../TIP-0018/tip-0018.md). Each native token is identified by its 38 bytes long
<i>Token ID</i>, that also identifies the unique identifier of the foundry, <i>Foundry ID</i>.

Given <i>Foundry ID</i>, the most recent unspent foundry output controlling the supply of the native token can be
fetched via the UTXO indexer API defined in [draft TIP 26](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/pull/62).

The foundry output may contain an immutable <i>Metadata Feature</i> that holds raw binary data. By encoding metadata in
JSON format adhering to the JSON schema defined in this TIP and placing it in the immutable <i>Metadata Feature</i> of
a foundry output, issuers can supply metadata to wallets, dApps and clients on-tangle, without the need for a
metadata server.

Standardizing the JSON schema for token metadata plays an important role in establishing interoperability of
decentralized applications and wallets.

### JSON Schema

The proposed JSON schema is located [here](./irc30.schema.json):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/main/tips/TIP-0030/irc30.schema.json",
  "title": "IRC30 Native Token Metadata Schema",
  "description": "A JSON schema for IRC30 compliant native token metadata",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "standard": {
      "description": "The IRC standard of the token metadata",
      "type": "string",
      "pattern": "^IRC30$"
    },
    "name": {
      "description": "The human-readable name of the native token",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "description": {
      "description": "The human-readable description of the token",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "symbol": {
      "description": "The symbol/ticker of the token",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "decimals": {
      "description": "Number of decimals the token uses (divide the token amount by 10^decimals to get its user representation)",
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 0
    },
    "url": {
      "description": "URL pointing to more resources about the token",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "logoUrl": {
      "description": "URL pointing to an image resource of the token logo",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "logo": {
      "description": "The svg logo of the token encoded as a byte string",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "standard",
    "name",
    "symbol",
    "decimals"
  ]
}
```

### Examples

The following examples are located in the [`examples/`](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/tree/main/tips/TIP-0030/examples) folder.

To try the schema validation in Python, install [jsonschema](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
package by running:
```bash
pip install jsonschema
```
Then navigate into the folder of this TIP (`tips/TIP-0030/`) of the cloned
[TIP repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips) and run the validation in console:
```bash
jsonschema -i examples/1-valid.json irc30.schema.json
```

If the validation fails, error messages are printed out to the console.

#### 1. A minimum valid token metadata JSON

```json
{
  "standard": "IRC30",
  "name": "FooCoin",
  "symbol": "FOO",
  "decimals": 3,
}
```

#### 2. A more descriptive valid token metadata JSON

```json
{
  "standard": "IRC30",
  "name": "FooCoin",
  "description": "FooCoin is the utility and governance token of FooLand, a revolutionary protocol in the play-to-earn crypto gaming field.",
  "symbol": "FOO",
  "decimals": 3,
  "url": "https://foocoin.io",
  "logoUrl": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR36VFfo1hH2RAwVs4zVJ5btkopGip5cW7ydY4jUQBrkR"
}
```

#### 3. Invalid token metadata

```json
{
  "standard": "IRC27",
  "name": "FooCoin",
  "description": "FooCoin is the utility and governance token of FooLand, a revolutionary protocol in the play-to-earn crypto gaming field.",
  "decimals": 0.5
}
```
The metadata JSON is not a valid IRC30 token metadata JSON as:
- The `standard` field is not `IRC30`
- `symbol` property is missing, although it is required, and
- `decimals` is not an integer.

## Rationale

The main motive of this design is to allow interoperability of applications handling native tokens while also leaving
room for optional, non-required fields that might be needed for certain use-cases.

Alternatively, a non-standardized token metadata structure would lead to a fragmented application space and hence
worse developer and user experiences while interacting with the network.

## Backwards Compatibility
IRC30 aims to be a minimum standard that can be compatible with future token standards, as long as the few originally
required fields are respected.
