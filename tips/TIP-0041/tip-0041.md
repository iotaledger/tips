# Summary

This document defines the Basic Output type and transaction validation rules for the IOTA protocol to support storage of
IOTA tokens, native tokens and Mana as well as layer 2 smart contract requests, among other functionality. It was
originally introduced in [TIP-18](../TIP-0018/tip-0018.md) and the functionality defined in this document is an
extension of the Basic output of TIP-18.

## Summary of changes compared to TIP-18

- Add `Mana` field.
- Remove `Native Tokens` field and add `Native Token Feature` to the allowed features. See [TIP-38 (Native Token Migration)](../TIP-0038/tip-0038.md#native-token-migration) for migration details.

# Motivation

This TIP defines an output type for the support of basic ledger functionality. Such outputs can
store IOTA tokens, native tokens and Mana. All unlock conditions and features defined in
[TIP-38](../TIP-0038/tip-0038.md) are supported and can be composed to create spending restrictions, attach metadata or
enable indexed data storage in the UTXO ledger. Layer 2 smart contract requests are enabled by posting requests through
the Tangle. Such requests can be crafted by including commands in the metadata of Basic outputs. This output thus
supports both the native tokenization on layer 1 as well as layer 2 smart contracts.

# Building Blocks

## Data Types & Subschema Notation

Data types and subschemas used throughout this TIP are defined in [TIP-21](../TIP-0021/tip-0021.md).

## Protocol Parameters

Protocol parameters used throughout this TIP are defined in [TIP-49](../TIP-0049/tip-0049.md).

## Transaction Payload

[TIP-45](../TIP-0045/tip-0045.md) is the basis for output validation in this TIP.

# Basic Output

A <i>Basic Output</i> can have several unlock conditions and optional features, including the ability to hold Native
Tokens. The combination of several features provide the base functionality for the output to be used as an on-ledger
smart contract request:

- Verified `Sender`,
- Attached `Metadata` that can encode the request payload for layer 2,
- `Return Amount` to get back the storage deposit,
- `Timelock` to be able to time requests,
- `Expiration` to recover funds in case of chain inactivity.

Besides, the <i>Tag Feature</i> is a tool to store arbitrary, indexed data with verified origin in the ledger.

## Additional Transaction Syntactic Validation Rules

- `Amount` field must fulfill the [storage deposit requirements](../TIP-0047/tip-0047.md) and must not be `0`.
- `Amount` field must be ≤ `Token Supply`.
- It must hold true that `1` ≤ `Unlock Conditions Count` ≤ `4`.
- `Unlock Condition Type` of an <i>Unlock Condition</i> must define one of the following types:
  - <i>Address Unlock Condition</i>
  - <i>Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition</i>
  - <i>Timelock Unlock Condition</i>
  - <i>Expiration Unlock Condition</i>
- <i>Unlock Conditions</i> must be sorted in ascending order based on their `Unlock Condition Type`.
- Syntactic validation of all present unlock conditions must pass.
- <i>Address Unlock Condition</i> must be present.
- It must hold true that `0` ≤ `Features Count` ≤ `4`.
- `Feature Type` of a <i>Feature</i> must define one of the following types:
  - <i>Sender Feature</i>
  - <i>Metadata Feature</i>
  - <i>Tag Feature</i>
  - <i>Native Token Feature</i>
- <i>Features</i> must be sorted in ascending order based on their `Feature Type`.
- Syntactic validation of all present features must pass.

## Additional Transaction Semantic Validation Rules

### Consumed Outputs

- The unlock of the input must correspond to `Address` field in the <i>Address Unlock Condition</i> and the unlock must
  be valid.
- The unlock is valid if and only if all unlock conditions and features present in the output validate.

### Created Outputs

- All <i>Unlock Condition</i> imposed transaction validation criteria must be fulfilled.
- All <i>Feature</i> imposed transaction validation criteria must be fulfilled.
