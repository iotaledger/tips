# Summary

This TIP proposes a UTXO-based transaction structure consisting of all the inputs and outputs of a transfer. Specifically, this TIP defines a transaction payload for the _messages_ described in [TIP-6](../TIP-0006/tip-0006.md).

# Motivation

There are several options on how transfers of IOTA coins can be embedded into the actual vertices of the Tangle. In the legacy IOTA protocol, each vertex corresponds to a single transaction, i.e. an input or an output. In order to support atomic transfers, input/output transactions have to be grouped into a so-called bundle and then either the entire bundle is applied to the ledger or none of its transactions.

The bundle concept has proven to be rather challenging in practices as validation can get very complex, especially in the context of reattachments. Therefore, this TIP proposes an alternative approach: It defines a self-contained transaction payload, containing the entire transfer, that is then embedded into a single Tangle message/vertex.

The new transaction structure should fulfill the following criteria:
- Support for Ed25519 signatures.
- Support for adding new types of signature schemes, addresses, inputs, and outputs as part of protocol upgrades.
- Implement the UTXO model.

# Detailed design

## UTXO

The *unspent transaction output* (UTXO) model defines a ledger state where balances are not directly associated to addresses but to the outputs of transactions. In this model, transactions reference outputs of previous transactions as inputs, which are consumed (removed) to create new outputs. A transaction must consume all the funds of the referenced inputs.

Using a UTXO-based model provides several benefits:
* Parallel validation of transactions.
* Easier double-spend detection, since conflicting transactions would reference the same UTXO.
* Replay-protection which is important when having reusable addresses. Replaying the same transaction would manifest itself as already being applied or existent and thus not have any impact.
* Balances are no longer strictly associated to addresses. This allows a higher level of abstraction and thus enables other types of outputs with particular unlock criteria.

Within a transaction using UTXOs, inputs and outputs make up the to-be-signed data of the transaction. The section unlocking the inputs is called the *unlock block*. An unlock block may contain a signature proving ownership of a given input's address and/or other unlock criteria.

The following image depicts the flow of funds using UTXO:

## Structure

### Serialized layout

A _Transaction Payload_ is made up of two parts:
1. The _Transaction Essence_ part which contains the inputs, outputs and an optional embedded payload.
2. The _Unlock Blocks_ which unlock the inputs of the _Transaction Essence_.

The serialized form of the transaction is deterministic, meaning the same logical transaction always results in the same serialized byte sequence. However, in contrast to Chrysalis Phase 2 [TIP-7](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/main/tips/TIP-0007/tip-0007.md) the inputs and outputs are considered as lists. They can contain duplicates and their serialization order matches the order of the list; they do not need to be sorted.

The *Transaction Payload ID* is the [BLAKE2b-256](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7693) hash of the entire serialized payload data including unlock blocks.

The following table describes the entirety of a _Transaction Payload_ in its serialized form following the notation from [draft TIP-21](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/pull/41):

### Transaction Essence

The <i>Transaction Essence</i> of a <i>Transaction Payload</i> carries the inputs, outputs, and an optional payload. The <i>Transaction Essence</i> is an explicit type and therefore starts with its own <i>Transaction Essence Type</i> byte which is of value 0.

#### Inputs

The `Inputs` field holds the inputs to consume in order to fund the outputs of the <i>Transaction Payload</i>. Currently, there is only one type of input, the <i>UTXO Input</i>. In the future, more types of inputs may be specified as part of protocol upgrades.

Each input must be accompanied by a corresponding <i>Unlock Block</i> at the same index in the <i>Unlock Blocks</i> part of the <i>Transaction Payload</i>.

##### UTXO Input

A <i>UTXO Input</i> is an input which references an unspent output of a previous transaction. This UTXO is uniquely defined by the _Transaction ID_ of that transaction together with corresponding output index. Each <i>UTXO Input</i> must be accompanied by an <i>Unlock Block</i> that is allowed to unlock the referenced output.

#### Outputs

The `Outputs` field holds the outputs that are created by the <i>Transaction Payload</i>. There are different output types, but they must all have an `Amount` field denoting the number of IOTA coins to deposit.

The following table lists all the output types that are currently supported as well as links to the corresponding specification. The _SigLockedSingleOutput_ as well as the _SigLockedDustAllowanceOutput_ introduced in Chrysalis Phase 2 [TIP-7](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/main/tips/TIP-0007/tip-0007.md) have been removed and are no longer supported.

#### Payload

The  _Transaction Essence_ itself can contain another payload as described in general in  [TIP-6](../TIP-0006/tip-0006.md). The [semantic validity](#semantic-validation) of the encapsulating _Transaction Payload_ does not have any impact on the payload.

The following table lists all the payload types that can be nested inside a _Transaction Essence_ as well as links to the corresponding specification:

| Name       | Type Value | TIP                                                 |

| Indexation | 2          | [TIP-6](../TIP-0006/tip-0006.md#indexation-payload) |

### Unlock Blocks

The `Unlock Blocks` field holds the unlock blocks unlocking inputs within a _Transaction Essence_.

The following table lists all the output types that are currently supported as well as links to the corresponding specification. The _Signature Unlock Block_ as well as the _Reference Unlock Block_ is specified as part of this TIP.

| Unlock Block Name | Type Value | TIP                                                                                                                   |

#### Signature Unlock Block

The <i>Signature Unlock Block</i> defines an <i>Unlock Block</i> which holds a signature signing the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the <i>Transaction Essence</i> (including the optional payload). It is serialized as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unlock Type</td>
    <td>uint8</td>
    <td>
      Set to <strong>value 0</strong> to denote a <i>Signature Unlock Block</i>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Signature <code>oneOf</code></td>
    <td colspan="2">
      <details>
        <summary>Ed25519 Signature</summary>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Signature Type</td>
            <td>uint8</td>
            <td>
              Set to <strong>value 0</strong> to denote an <i>Ed25519 Signature</i>.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Public key</td>
            <td>ByteArray[32]</td>
            <td>The Ed25519 public key of the signature.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Signature</td>
            <td>ByteArray[64]</td>
            <td>The Ed25519 signature signing the Blake2b-256 hash of the serialized <i>Transaction Essence</i>.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </details>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### Unlock syntactic validation

* `Signature` must contain an _Ed25519 Signature_.
* The _Signature Unlock Block_ must be unique, i.e. there must not be any other _Signature Unlock Blocks_ in the `Unlock Blocks` field of the transaction payload with the same signature.

#### Reference Unlock Block

The <i>Reference Unlock Block</i> defines an <i>Unlock Block</i> which references a previous <i>Unlock Block</i> (which must not be another <i>Reference Unlock Block</i>). It **must** be used if multiple inputs can be unlocked via the same <i>Unlock Block</i>. It is serialized as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unlock Type</td>
    <td>uint8</td>
    <td>
      Set to <strong>value 1</strong> to denote a <i>Reference Unlock Block</i>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reference</td>
    <td>uint16</td>
    <td>Represents the index of a previous unlock block.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### Unlock syntactic validation

* The _Reference Unlock Block_ at index i must have `Reference` < i and the unlock block at index `Reference` must be a _Signature Unlock Block_.

Example:
Consider a <i>Transaction Essence</i> containing the <i>UTXO Inputs</i> 0, 1 and 2, where 0 and 2 are both spending outputs belonging to the same Ed25519 address A and 1 is spending from a different address B. This results in the following structure of the <i>Unlock Blocks</i> part:
| Index | Unlock Block                                                                             |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | A _Signature Unlock Block_ holding the Ed25519 signature for address A.                  |
| 1     | A _Signature Unlock Block_ holding the Ed25519 signature for address B.                  |
| 2     | A _Reference Unlock Block_ which references 0, as both require the same signature for A. |

## Validation

A <i>Transaction Payload</i> has different validation stages, since some validation steps can only be executed when certain information has (or has not) been received. We therefore distinguish between syntactic and semantic validation

The different output types and optional output feature blocks introduced by [draft TIP-18](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/pull/38) add additional constraints to the transaction validation rules, but since these are specific to the given outputs and features, they are discussed for each [output type](https://github.com/lzpap/protocol-rfcs/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#output-design) and [feature block type](https://github.com/lzpap/protocol-rfcs/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#output-features) separately.

### Syntactic validation

Syntactic validation is checked as soon as the transaction data has been received in its entirety. It validates the structure but not the signatures of the transaction. If the transaction does not pass this stage, it must not be broadcast further and can be discarded right away.

The following criteria defines whether a payload passes the syntactical validation:

* Essence:
  * `Transaction Type` value must denote a _Transaction Essence_.
  * `Network ID` must match the value of the current network.
  * Inputs:
    * `Inputs Count` must be 0 < x ≤ `Max Inputs Count`.
    * For each input the following must be true:
      * `Input Type` must denote a _UTXO Input_.
      * `Transaction Output Index` must be 0 ≤ x < `Max Outputs Count`.
    * Each pair of `Transaction ID` and `Transaction Output Index` must be unique in the list of inputs.
  * Outputs:
    * `Outputs Count` must be 0 < x ≤ `Max Outputs Count`.
    * For each input the following must be true:
      * `Output Type` must match one of the values described under [Outputs](#outputs).
      * The output itself must pass syntactic validation.
    * The sum of all `Amount` fields must not exceed `Max IOTA Supply`.
  * Payload (if present):
    * `Payload Type` must match one of the values described under [Payload](#payload).
    * `Data fields` must be correctly parsable in the context of the `Payload Type`.
    * The payload itself must pass syntactic validation.
* Unlock Blocks:
  * `Unlock Blocks Count` must match `Inputs Count` of the _Transaction Essence_.
  * For each unlock block the following must be true:
    * Each `Unlock Block Type` must match one of the values described under [Unlock Blocks](#unlock-blocks).
    * The unlock block itself must pass syntactic validation.
* Given the type and length information, the _Transaction Payload_ must consume the entire byte array of the `Payload` field of the encapsulating object.

### Semantic validation

The Semantic validation of a _Transaction Payload_ is performed when its encapsulating message is confirmed by a milestone. The semantic validity of transactions depends on the order in which they are processed. Thus, it is necessary that all the nodes in the network perform the checks in the same order, no matter the order in which the transactions are received. This is assured by using the White-Flag ordering as described in  [TIP-2](../TIP-0002/tip-0002.md#deterministically-ordering-the-tangle).

Processing transactions according to the White-Flag ordering enables users to spend UTXOs which are created in the same milestone confirmation cone, as long as the spending transaction comes after the funding transaction in the aforementioned White-Flag order. In this case, it is recommended that users include the _Message ID_ of the funding transaction as a parent of the message containing the spending transaction.

The following criteria defines whether a payload passes the semantic validation:
* Each input must reference a valid UTXO, i.e. the output referenced by the input's `Transaction ID` and `Transaction Output Index` is known (booked) and unspent.
* `Inputs Commitment` must be equal to the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the serialized outputs that are referenced as inputs. The order of the serialized outputs must be the same as their order in `Inputs`.
* The transaction must spend the entire coin balance, i.e. the sum of the `Amount` fields of all the UTXOs referenced by inputs must match the sum of the `Amount` fields of all outputs.
* The sum of all `Native Token Counts` in the UTXOs referenced by inputs plus the sum of all `Native Token Counts` in the outputs must not be larger than `Max Native Token Count`.
* The transaction must be balanced in terms of native tokens, i.e. the amount of native tokens present in all the UTXOs referenced by inputs equals to that of outputs. Otherwise, the foundry outputs controlling outstanding native token balances must be present in the transaction. The validation of the foundry output(s) determines if the outstanding balances are valid.
* Each output and all its [output feature blocks](https://github.com/lzpap/protocol-rfcs/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#output-features) must pass semantic validation in the context of the following input:
  1. The _Transaction Payload_,
  2. the list of UTXOs referenced by inputs and
  3. the milestone index and Unix timestamp of the confirming milestone.
* Each unlock block must be valid with respect to the UTXO referenced by the input of the same index:
  * If it is a _Signature Unlock Block_:
    * The `Signature Type` must match the `Address Type` of the UTXO, 
    * the BLAKE2b-256 hash of `Public Key` must match the `Address` of the UTXO and
    * the `Signature` field must contain a valid signature for `Public Key`.
  * If it is a _Reference Unlock Block_, the referenced _Signature Unlock Block_ must be valid with respect to the UTXO.
  * If it is an _Alias Unlock Block_:
    * The address unlocking the UTXO must be an _Alias Address_.
    * The referenced _Unlock Block_ unlocks the alias defined by the unlocking address of the UTXO.
  * If it is an _NFT Unlock Block_:
    * The address unlocking the UTXO must be a _NFT Address_.
    * The referenced _Unlock Block_ unlocks the NFT defined by the unlocking address of the UTXO.

If a _Transaction Payload_ passes the semantic validation, its referenced UTXOs must be marked as spent and its new outputs must be created/booked in the ledger. The _Message ID_ of the message encapsulating the processed payload then also becomes part of the input for the White-Flag Merkle tree hash of the confirming milestone ([TIP-4](../TIP-0004/tip-0004.md)).

Transactions that do not pass semantic validation are ignored. Their UTXOs are not marked as spent and their outputs are not booked in the ledger.

## Miscellaneous

### Transaction timestamps

Since transaction timestamps – whether they are signed or not – do not provide any guarantee of correctness, they have been left out of the _Transaction Payload_. Instead, the global timestamp of the confirming milestone ([TIP-6](../TIP-0008/tip-0008.md)) is uesd.

### Address reuse

While, in contrast to Winternitz one-time signatures (W-OTS), producing multiple Ed25519 signatures for the same private key and address does not decrease its security, it still drastically reduces the privacy of users. It is thus considered best practice that applications and services create a new address per deposit to circumvent these privacy issues.

In essence, Ed25519 support allows for smaller transaction sizes and to safely spend funds which were sent to an already used deposit address. Ed25519 addresses are not meant to be used like email addresses. See this [Bitcoin wiki article](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse) for further information.

# Drawbacks

* The new transaction format is the core data type within the IOTA ecosystem. Changing it means that all projects need to accommodate it, including wallets, web services, client libraries and applications using IOTA in general. It is not possible to keep these changes backwards compatible, meaning that all nodes must upgrade to further participate in the network.
* Additionally, local snapshots can no longer be represented by a list of addresses and their balances, since the ledger is now made up of the UTXOs on which the actual funds reside. Therefore, local snapshot file schemes have to be adjusted to incorporate the transaction hashes, output indices, and then the destination addresses including the balances.

# Rationale and alternatives

* Introducing this new transaction structure allows for extensions in the future, to accommodate new requirements. With the support for Ed25519 addresses/signatures, transaction size is drastically reduced and allows for safe re-signing in case of address reuse. Due to the switch to a complete binary transaction, the transaction size is reduced even further, saving network bandwidth and processing time.
* Other transaction structures have been considered but they would have misused existing transaction fields to accommodate for new features, instead of putting them into a proper descriptive structure. Additionally, those ideas would not have been safe against replay attacks, which deems reusing the old transaction structure, for example for Ed25519 addresses/signatures, as infeasible.
* Not switching to the new transaction structure described in this TIP would have led to more people losing funds because of W-OTS address reuse and it would prevent extending the IOTA protocol further down the line.
