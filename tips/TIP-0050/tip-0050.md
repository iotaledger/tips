# Summary

This document proposes an extension to the address format to make them configurable. This enables an address to opt-in
or -out of certain functionality, like disabling the receipt of Native Tokens, NFT Outputs or Timelock Unlock
Conditions.

# Motivation

[TIP-18](../TIP-0018/tip-0018.md) introduced a multi-asset ledger. Every user is able to receive different kinds of
Outputs (Basic, Alias, NFTs) and the ledger has useful functionality like time-based unlock conditions. Not every user
wants to deal with the complexity of this functionality, but users were so far unable to disable them. Certain users do
not want to receive certain asset classes like Native Tokens or Non-Fungible Tokens for legal reasons. Configurable
addresses solve this issue by adding capabilities to addresses. Such addresses self-describe their capabilities which
make it possible to express whether an address can receive such assets. As a result, these address capabilities impose
additional validation rules for transactions in which outputs contain such addresses in their unlock conditions.

This TIP builds on the address format defined in TIP-11 in a backwards-compatible manner, while extending the
capabilities of the address.

# Binary serialization

The format of a restricted address is a container around other address types. A restricted address is serialized in
three parts:

- The first field describes the type of the address.
- The second field contains another concrete Address type.
- The third field contains bitflags in a variable-size byte array which are the _Allowed Capabilities_. See
  [Allowed Capabilities](#allowed-capabilities) for their serialization.

## Data Types & Subschema Notation

Data types and subschemas used throughout this TIP are defined in [TIP-21](../TIP-0021/tip-0021.md).

## Restricted Address

The following table shows the mapping from the address type of the **first byte** to the address type:

| Address            | Type Byte as `uint8` | Bech32 Encoded |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Restricted Address | 48                   | iota1**x**...  |

The following table shows the serialization of a _Restricted Address_:

<details>
  <summary>Restricted Address</summary>

### Unlocking

The address is unlocked in a transaction if and only if the underlying `Address` is unlocked.

## Allowed Capabilities

Allowed Capabilities are represented as a `ByteArray` with a length prefix. For the address that contains them to be
valid, the following conditions must hold:

- The length prefix must be `0`, `1` or `2`.
  - This condition may be relaxed in the future and implementations should anticipate greater lengths.
- Bit indices start at `0`. For each byte, they are counted starting from the least-significant bit. If there was a
  previous byte, the indices continue where the previous byte's indices left off.
  - For example: In this list of two bytes with the bit patterns `0001 0000` and `0000 0100`, bits with indices `4` and
    `10` are set.

### Capability Flags

The following table shows the mapping from the bit pattern to the capability flags, where the `Flag Index` is the index
of the bit.

This list is an Allowlist: If the bit is `1` (**set**) the address has the capability, if the bit is `0` (**unset**) it
does not have it.

| Flag Index | Capability (if flag is set)                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0          | Can receive Outputs with Native Tokens.                             |
| 1          | Can receive Outputs with Mana.                                      |
| 2          | Can receive Outputs with a Timelock Unlock Condition.               |
| 3          | Can receive Outputs with an Expiration Unlock Condition.            |
| 4          | Can receive Outputs with a Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition. |
| 5          | Can receive Account Outputs.                                        |
| 6          | Can receive Anchor Outputs.                                         |
| 7          | Can receive NFT Outputs.                                            |
| 8          | Can receive Delegation Outputs.                                     |

### Semantic transaction validation rules

This section defines the transaction validation rules coming into effect with the capability flags. These are defined in
terms of the flags being **unset**. If the flag is **set**, the rule does not apply to the transaction.

If an output is created on the output side of a transaction with an _Address Unlock Condition_, _State Controller
Address Unlock Condition_, _Governor Address Unlock Condition_ or _Expiration Unlock Condition_ containing a _Restricted
Address_, the transaction is only valid if the following conditions, corresponding to the _Allowed Capabilities_ flags,
hold for that output:

- Flag 0 **unset**: The transaction is invalid if the output's `Native Tokens Count != 0`.
- Flag 1 **unset**: The transaction is invalid if the output's `Mana != 0`.
- Flag 2 **unset**: The transaction is invalid if the output contains an unlock condition of type Timelock Unlock
  Condition.
- Flag 3 **unset**: The transaction is invalid if the output contains an unlock condition of type Expiration Unlock
  Condition.
- Flag 4 **unset**: The transaction is invalid if the output contains an unlock condition of type Storage Deposit Return
  Unlock Condition.
- Flag 5 **unset**: The transaction is invalid if the output is an Account Output.
- Flag 6 **unset**: The transaction is invalid if the output is an Anchor Output.
- Flag 7 **unset**: The transaction is invalid if the output is an NFT Output.
- Flag 8 **unset**: The transaction is invalid if the output is an Delegation Output.

## Examples

### Allowed Capabilities Bit Patterns

The following shows examples of Allowed Capabilities bit patterns and their meaning. This only shows the first two bytes
of the Allowed Capabilities array.

| Bit Pattern         | Meaning                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0000 0011 0000 0000 | Can receive Native Tokens and Mana.                      |
| 1110 0000 0000 0001 | Can receive Account, Anchor, NFT and Delegation Outputs. |
| 0000 1100 0000 0000 | Can receive Outputs with time-based unlock conditions.   |

# Rationale & Alternatives

- The default capability byte should be `0x00` as `0` is a sensible default value, and results in the desired
  configuration since adding new flags in the future would mean that addresses automatically opt-out of that capability,
  until they explicitly set the flag to `1`. That is the reason why the flags are defined as an Allow List rather than a
  Deny List. A `0x00` byte as the default disallows every available capability for restricted address types.
- An alternative would be to reuse the current address type byte as both a type indicator and for capability flags. This
  makes serialization less straightforward as there could be many bit patterns that identify a given address type.
  Separating the address type and capabilities separates serialization and capability setting & extraction, which are
  two different concerns.
- Another alternative would be to have two versions of each address type: An unrestricted one and a restricted one. The
  former would allow every capability implicitly, and the latter - in contrast - disallows everything by default. This
  would result in a proliferation of address types which is undesirable.
- Backwards-compatibility with the existing address format is important since addresses are highly user-facing and users
  expect them to be stable and permanent. Thus, adding a new configurable version of addresses means
  backwards-compatibility with previous address types as they are not replaced, while also allowing for configurable
  versions of each address to be created.
- The rules for restricted addresses do not apply to the _Return Address_ of a _Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_
  (SDRUC) because the requirements towards outputs in such a return transaction are already as restricted as a fully
  restricted address, as defined in [TIP-38](../TIP-0038/tip-0038.md#storage-deposit-return-unlock-condition).
- For unlocking, the Restricted Address must be resolved to its underlying address. This is because it is only a
  container around another address type and is not a standalone identity itself. With this approach, users can add
  restrictions on existing addresses, but it continues to act as if it was the underlying address for Unlocks in a
  transaction or in Sender and Issuer Features.
