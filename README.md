# Tangle Improvement Proposal (TIP) Repository

TIPs are improvement proposals for bettering the IOTA technology stack.

Building the IOTA ecosystem is a community effort, therefore we welcome anyone to propose, discuss and debate ideas that will later become formalized TIPs.

## Propose new ideas

Do you have an idea how to improve the IOTA technology stack?
- Head over to the [discussions](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/discussions) page to browse already submitted ideas or share yours!
- Once your idea is discussed, you can submit a draft TIP ([template here](./tip-template.md)) as a PR to the repository.
- You will receive feedback from the TIP Editors and review from core devs.
- Once accepted, your TIP is merged as Draft.
- It is your responsibility to drive its implementation and to present a clear plan on how the new feature will be adopted by the network.
- Once implementation is ready and testing yields satisfactory result, the TIP becomes Proposed.
- Proposed TIPs that are supported by majority of the network become Active.

You may find more information about the TIP Process in [TIP-1](./tips/TIP-0001/tip-0001.md).
